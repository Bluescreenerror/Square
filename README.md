# Square
It will work only if you run it on MS paint and if your native resolution is 1920 * 1080p. I can make it work on other res too but I'm just too lazy and well nobody is going to even run it so.

`pip install pyautogui to install pyautogui module`

`python3 {PATH of the .py file} to run the file via the windows terminal`

There's a 5 second interval. Open MS paint in the meantime. Enjoy!

If you're reading this, I love you <3
